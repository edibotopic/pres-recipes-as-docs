Documentation is often talked about as a kind of "recipe".

# Some ideas to start

<v-clicks>

- ðŸ§  **Metaphor** - recipes are a common metaphor for documentation
- ðŸ¤· **Ambiguity** - recipes can work, even when ambiguous or imprecise
- ðŸ¥‡ **Effectiveness** - recipes must generate enjoyment to be effective
- ðŸ”§ **Recipes-as-code** - recipes have their own markup and tooling

## Cookbooks

![alt text](./public/cookBooks.jpg){width=500px lazy}

Many kinds: traditional, scientific, industrial, artistic, ...

<!--
These are all examples of what we might call "cookbooks".

They all, however, deviate from the traditional idea of a cookbook.

One uses recipes as a means of artistic expression.

Another refers to the design of industrial food operations.

## Explanatory text...

</v-click>

<!--
This is closer to the traditional idea of a recipe.
It's notably terse, only focusing on the necessary steps.
An important feature of this recipe is that it is filled
with ambiguities:

- "good shape"
- "boil gently"
- "sufficient butter"

Below this we have another recipe, but this is from a
scientific paper.
Superficially, they are similar, but a paper is generally
more precise.
The idea of a paper is that it can be reproduced _exactly_.

On the right is something that is strictly explanatory.
The information is useful but no steps are described to
apply the knowledge.

# Traditional recipes

## Customisation and substitution...

![sifted flour or xanthan](/recipes/orXanthan.jpg){ width=650px lazy}

<!--
An interesting feature of old recipes is that their users would customise them.

Here, we see ingredients being changed and quantities being adjusted.

For example, it is written in pencil that xanthan gum can be used instead of sifted flour.

However, it is not said why this works, or what other substitutions might work.

## Tutorials

<br><br><br>

- Skills are learned through doing

- Learner makes observations during process

- Results in a concrete outcome

- Skill can be taken forward

> see https://diataxis.fr/ for how
>
> recipes can be an analogy for docs

<!--
As most on the call will know, these how-to guides
are distinct from tutorials.

A tutorial is not only about the steps required to
achieve a goal, it is also about learning a skill.

Here is an example of a journalist talking about
teaching his children to cook.

He suggests a specific learning activity that can
help children learn this skill: homemade tomato sauce.

These distinctions are expertly made by Daniele Procida
on the diataxis website.

<!--

Let's briefly discuss cooking in the context of the four diataxis types.

How-to guides are what we just saw: step-by-step guides oriented towards a specific outcome.

Tutorials, on the other hand, involve learning and the acquisition of skill.
An effective tutorial sends the learner on their way: they can apply the skill elswhere.

References state facts concisely: they are consulted for information.
Here is a depiction of the notion in French cooking of mother sauces.
This is the idea that they are a small number of sauces that can be
used to develop further derived sauces.

Lastly, there is the explanation, which provides deeper understanding of a topic.
Here, for example, the physical property of viscosity is explained.
This knowledge is not necessary to make a tomato sauce, but it can
inform future efforts to make the sauce.

A last point to make here is that these types are inter-connected.
One is not better than the other or more foundational.

Consider: someone who can make a tomato sauce now consults the reference â€” they can do more!

# Levels of explanation and precision

"Add tbsp. of baking soda to green tea for the pink colour"

<div v-click="1">

![alt text](/pinkTea.png){width=500px lazy}

</div>

<div v-click="1">

"Add baking soda until pH 7.5 is reached to ionize polyphenols<br>
that are present and create the pink colour" â€” [but, who cares?]{style="color:pink"}

</div>

<!--
I want to focus specifically on explanation for a moment.

This is something close to my heart because it was one of the biggest hurdles when I was a teacher.

Even in a recipe there can be some degree of explanation, although usually very little.
It is possible to make a kind of pink tea from green tea. Recipes that describe this
will instruct you to add baking soda to product the pink colour.

This is indeed an explanation, but not a very deep one.
A deeper explanation would state that baking soda makes the tea less acidic,
and that this has a chemical effect on molecules called polyphenols, and the
transformation this causes results in the pink colour.

When I was teaching, students would sometimes wonder why the deeper explanation is necessary
at all, when without it we can still produce the same effect.

One practical reason in this case is that it provides a rationale for substituting the baking soda.
Perhaps we don't want to add something that contains sodium to the tea; we don't have to, because
all we need is something that reduces acidity, and there are many salts without sodium that do this.

There have many attempts in recent years to make recipes more scientific, and often this involves
the inclusion of deeper explanations.

Another example here is from this Unix book.

They are describing the manuipulation of files on Unix systems.

They use recipes as an example of a tree-like directory structure.

It's clever, because it points to the modular nature of recipes.

> The essence of metaphor is

> â€• George Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By

<!--
For example, we can write some functions in python that
take inputs and return outputs.

These functions can be composed together to form a complete recipe.

Knuth suggested that recipes share many characteristics with algorithms.

They consist of inputs and outputs, they specify exactly the steps needed,
the steps should be possible to follow, they stop at some point, and 
they produce an expected result.

Usually, however, it is identified that the metaphor breaks down, as they
always do.

For example, an undefined variable is not OK in an algorithm but it might
be OK in a recipe.

title: obstacles

**Epistemological obstacle**: the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard (1884-1962) suggested that in many periods of history, 
there were prevailing images, metaphors and analogies that functioned as obstacles to thought.
The risk is that we can become so enamored with a metaphor that we impose a constraint on our thinking,
blocking us from ideas that could be better or more true.
Sometimes it is necessary to analyse the metaphors we use and get rid of them if necessary.

## Tools for thought

![alt text](/public/newsletterScreenie.png){width=350px}

::right::

<br><br><br><br>
Advances in human history are often
accelerated by new ways of representing ideas.

Examples include notation, diagrams and symbols.

A chemical "recipe" looks something like this:

$$NaHCO_3 + H_2O â†’ NaOH + H_2CO_3$$

A notation had to be **invented** to represent such
combinations and transformations effectively.

_What would a notation for software docs look like?_

- Consider what you omit in the analogy
- Reflect on efforts to "fix" recipes
- Ask yourself: are there better analogies?
- Be careful of: epistemological obstacles
